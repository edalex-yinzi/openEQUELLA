<!--
  This entrance provides access to the New UI of `My resources` page in Selection Session with the New UI
  turned on, namely Legacy content.

  The script must be placed within a div because any script outside the div will be placed in the head
  by the back-end. Since head scripts are executed only once, it will lead to an issue in the Selection Session
  where the new UI pages fail to re-render upon switching pages.

  The global object `window` has a property named `oEQRender` which provides a function to output
  the New UI of `My resources` page to the div mentioned above.
-->
<div id="myResourcesPage">
  <script>window["oEQRender"].myResourcesPage()</script>
</div>
