openEQUELLA is a digital repository that provides a single platform to house your teaching and
learning, research, media, and library content.

Builds for each openEQUELLA Release can be found on the [Releases
page](https://github.com/openequella/openEQUELLA/releases "EQUELLA Releases").

(NOTE: The current stable version - starting from 2019.1 - is built from `master`, where as active
development is undertaken on the repository's default branch `develop`. Therefore `develop` is
considered the project's 'unstable' branch.)

The project's homepage and documentation can be found at <https://openequella.github.io/>.
